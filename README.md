Decrypting a Substitution Cipher with Markov Chain Monte Carlo

This was the culminating project for my Computational Statistics class.

This is a slightly complicated way of deciphering texts encoded by substitution ciphers.  
The algorithm attempts to decipher texts one step at a time until it reaches what it thinks is English.
Unfortunately, if it actually deciphers the text, we don't know; it doesn't settle of the solution, it zooms past it.
